# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview of Statistical Analysis:
The purpose of the statistical analysis was help determine based on the weather temperatures from June and December months if a surf shop would optimal temperatures for surfing conditions which would allow for a substainable surfings business.

## Results:
The month `June` temperature statistical analysis indicates `Min Temp 64` degrees, `Max Temp 85` degrees, and `Avg(mean) 74` degrees.

## Summary:
The two monthly time periods give a basic understanding of the temperatures that could substain year round surfing condition, but with other months of statistical analysis complied along with additional data parameters like precipition & wind would give greater insight. If more data parameters we're added to the analysis it would give optimal days out of the year for ideal surfing conditions and understanding if additional gear like dry suits for cooler timeframes.
